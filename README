------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TopoManager API provides runtime information about the allocated job
partition on IBM Blue Gene and Cray XT machines. For documentation, read
"TopoManager.h". This is the only file which needs to interface with the
application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile, edit the Makefile so that the variables are set for the
right architecture.

Type make which will create libtmgr.a. Add -ltmgr at the link line.


---------------------------
EXPERIMENTS:
---------------------------
1. full_overlap

2. partial_overlap

3. flow
Reads the map from the mapfile. The number of the mapfile is passed as an argument to build_process_map.

Format for the map file

Sender          Receiver
x1 y1 z1 ---->  x2 y2 z2

Compile them using the corresponding option in makefile.
Right now, each of them has been instrumented with calls for obtaining hpm counters.

The output is bgp_print files from where we extract the bandwidth data.
